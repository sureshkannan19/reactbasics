          For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy
          little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world
          fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple
          pies... The store became a success in no time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie
          Shop moved into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it
          became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies
          from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You
          are now looking at the result of this: our very own online store,
          making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel
          like it!
